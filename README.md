# Introduction

This is a practice project of ST558 course at NC State. The data is
offered by [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).  
The data set is made of statistics associsated with articles published
by Mashable. It includes 61 attributes, among which are 58 predictive
attributes, 2 non-predictive and 1 goal (reponse) field.  
The goal of this project, from my perspective, is practicing modeling
using R with both linear model and non linear model.The purpose of this
project is to find a relatively better way to predict *Number of Shares*
of those articles, using the provided associated statistics.

# About the data

As we know before, there are 61 fields. According to the [data
description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity),
from column \#3 to columns \#60 are the predictors. While I have no
knowledge about each of them, I can see there are a couple of
perspecives that we can group them.  
1\) *Column 3 to Column 13* are all numeric predictors. Among them,
Column 3 to Column Column 7, and column 12 are about tokens of the
article; Column 8 to Column Column 11, and column 13 are about the
links, image, video, and keywords of the articles.  
2\) *Column 14 to Column 19* are all about the topic, or channel of the
data. So here it will tag 7 types of channels: Lifestyle, Entertainment,
Business, Social Media, Tech and World.  
3\) *Column 20 to Column 28* are all about key word. For example, worst
keyword, best keyword, average keyword, etc.  
4\) *Column 29 to Column 31* are about self reference. They capture the
min, avg and max shares of referenced atritles in mashable.  
5\) *Colun 32 to Column 29* is aboue the timing of the article. Those
are flags to tag out if the article is published in Monday to Sunday,
and also if itâ€™s on weekend.  
6\) *Column 40 to Column 44* are about the Closeness to LDA topics, with
topic 0 to topic 4 respectively.  
7\) *Colum 45 to Column 60* are all about [Natural Language Processing
(NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) result
of the artcle. They include polarity, subjectivity, sentiment of the
article.

To start the analysis, we first look at Monday data, and use Rmarkdown
*Knit with Parameter* for all the weekdays. Also, a 70-30 split will be
made for modeling training and testing. Last but not least, I choose to
predict a binary response, which is dividing the shares into two groups
(\< 1400 and \>=1400).
